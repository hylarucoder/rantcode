# Tasks

This folder is for task‑style documents that drive the Tasks view in rantcode.

Suggested frontmatter fields:

- `title`: short summary of the task
- `status`: e.g. `backlog`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`
- `owner`: who is driving this
- `priority`: e.g. `P0`, `P1`, `P2`

Keep each file focused on a single task or tightly related set of todos.
