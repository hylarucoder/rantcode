# Docs Conventions for rantcode

This `docs/` folder is used as the source of truth for the **document‑driven workflow** that rantcode expects.

- `design/` – higher‑level design docs and RFCs for features or subsystems.
- `overview/` – project overviews, onboarding notes, and how‑to guides.
- `spec/` – detailed specs and MDX documents that describe desired behavior.
- `task/` – task/issue style documents (with frontmatter) that drive the Tasks view.

Keep docs small and focused, and prefer updating spec/task files together with code changes so that documentation stays useful and in sync with behavior.
